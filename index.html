              head element is the susbequent, and it contains all the

            Body can contain main section which can furtehr contain header,
            navigation, sections, articles etc etc... (checkout MDN on these if
            you get stuck)

          <li>
            It is good prctice to use HTML semantic elements rather than
            'neutral' ones such as div and span. Semantic elements enable better
            accessiblity for both users and developers (SEO for eg...)
          </li>
          <li>
            Elements can have id or class which is then useful for styling them.
            Essentially id is a more specific element than a class and will
            always take precedence. We can add more classes to an element if we
            want to be specific on some styling parts

            GOOD LUCK to me with this. I will write notes as we go through the
            course, but below are some principles from pre-work
          </li>
          <li>
            A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our
            code.
          </li>
          <li>
            Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a
            script.
          </li>
          <li>
            An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data.
          </li>
          <li>
            A for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task
            on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be
            executed over and over. 'if' statements are used for flow to be
            interrupted
          </li>
          <li>
            A for loop contains 3 important statements: 1.
            <strong>starting point</strong> for our loop. Since we want to start
            at the beginning of the array - variable with a value of 0: let x =
            0; 2. <strong>the condition</strong> As long as the number in the
            variable x is less than the length of the array, the loop will keep
            running: x < shapes.length; 3. what allows the array to iterate over
            each item. Since indices follow a predictable pattern, we know the
            number increases by 1 each time. The code x++ is a shortcut way of
            writing x+1
          </li>
          <li>
            Functions are the building blocks of JS. When we create a function,
            we are defining a block of code that performs a specific task and
            giving it a unique name. However, just defining a function does not
            mean it will execute in our code automatically --> to execute a
            function, we must call it in our code.
