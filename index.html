            A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our
            code.
          </li>
          <li>
            Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a
            script.
          </li>
          <li>
            An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data.
          </li>
          <li>
            A for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task
            on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be
            executed over and over. 'if' statements are used for flow to be
            interrupted
          </li>
          <li>
            A for loop contains 3 important statements: 1.
            <strong>starting point</strong> for our loop. Since we want to start
            at the beginning of the array - variable with a value of 0: let x =
            0; 2. <strong>the condition</strong> As long as the number in the
            variable x is less than the length of the array, the loop will keep
            running: x < shapes.length; 3. what allows the array to iterate over
            each item. Since indices follow a predictable pattern, we know the
            number increases by 1 each time. The code x++ is a shortcut way of
            writing x+1
          </li>
          <li>
            Functions are the building blocks of JS. When we create a function,
            we are defining a block of code that performs a specific task and
            giving it a unique name. However, just defining a function does not
            mean it will execute in our code automatically --> to execute a
            function, we must call it in our code.
